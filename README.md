# ONT_read_CDR_spanning
Here in this repo, we are trying to investigate 
1. what the likihood of reads that cover multiple sub CDR in aggregate present multiple sub CDRs on single molecule
2. For the single reads that cover multiple sub CDRs, how likely are neighbouring sub CDRs to show CENPA enrichment/ H3K9me3 depletion?


Methods: 
In order to be able to define enrichment or depletion on the single molecule level, we must have a concrete threshold, which is mathematically calculated based
